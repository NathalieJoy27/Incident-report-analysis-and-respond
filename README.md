# Incident report analysis and respond

## Objective


This project focus on responding the incident using NIST cybersecurity framework such as Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover. This activity presents a complete incident report analysis to establish. As a security analyst it is important to understand how to proper reassemble a security analysis by given that it helps to coordinate the team to help mitigate future attacks. 
### Skills Learned


-Recognize and understand the assets, risks, and vulnerabilities affected by the incident.
-Ensure that threat detection systems are aligned with the organizationâ€™s assets.
-Activate protective measures like firewalls, encryption, and access controls to limit the impact of the incident.
-Ensure that critical systems and data are backed up and segregated from the compromised environment.
-Monitor systems in real-time to identify unusual or malicious activities during and after the incident.
-Use logging and alert systems to identify patterns related to the incident.
-Initiate incident response plans, including containment, eradication, and recovery.
-Communicate with internal teams and external stakeholders about the situation and response measures.
-Document actions taken during the incident for post-event analysis.
-Restore affected systems and data to operational status.
-Implement improvements and updates to systems, policies, and training to prevent recurrence.
-Conduct a post-incident.
### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark,tcpdump) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Identify Network attacks.
- Analyze Network layer Communication TCP/IP model and OSI model.
- Analyze Network attacks.
- Analysis of Network Hardening.
